	<h1>Class Example</h1> 
	<p>Programming with classes in Python is easy after you get a feel of what it looks like. Here's a basic example of Python code with classes. Don't hesitate to look back at the <a href="">previous page</a> if you're having trouble understanding a line.</p> 
	<pre>
	<code> 
class Classroom: 
     def __init__(self, room_number, vacant=True) 
          self.room_number = room_number 
          self.vacant = vacant 

     def is_vacant(self):  
          print self.vacant 

cpsc_235 = Classroom(176, False)

cpsc_235 = is_vacant()
	</code>  
	</pre>
	<p>Now that you've learned all about coding with classes, it's time to give it a try yourself!</p>
